                <h1>Learning Programmes & Workshops</h1>
                <h2>Environmental Leaders Programme</h2>
                <p>The Environmental Leaders Programme helps youth leaders at schools understand environmental and social problems in South Africa and the world.</p>
                <p>The level-appropriate syllabus focuses on fundamental concepts, critical analysis, problem-solving, and teamwork. Examples of topics include:</p>
                <p>Community recycling and waste management;</p>
                <p>Natural and environmental sciences;</p>
                <p>Climate change understanding and action;</p>
                <p>Ethics and leadership; and</p>
                <p>Presentation skills</p>
                <p>The Environmental Leaders Programme runs in an interactive workshop format with 1-12 days of facilitation depending on needs and available budget. It often falls part of an environmental club or a pre-existing school leadership programme.</p>

                <h1>Garden-Based Learning</h1>
                
                <p>Garden-Based Learning (GLB) utilises school food gardens as a teaching tool for curriculum integration and holistic learning.</p>
                <p>The interactive GLB workshops incorporate environmental and social ethics and are designed to engage learners in real-world experiences. Strong emphasis is placed on nutrition, science literacy in natural sciences, and navigating the link between nature and our environment and basic human needs.</p>
                <p>FTFA has developed two approaches to our Garden-Based Learning programme and workshops:</p>
                <p>1.Customised workshops based on selected sections of our Growing Green book and the needs of learners.</p>
                <p>2.A structured programme, normally integrated as an extra-curricular activity, which takes place over a year.</p>
              
            </div>

                <h1>Curriculum Integration: One-Day Workshops & Short Courses</h1>
               
                <p>Curriculum Integration workshops focus on helping teachers tap into contemporary environmental topics in the classroom. These touch on a wide variety of subjects. Whilst normally linked to natural sciences, it is most beneficial when incorporated across school subjects.</p>
                <p>The level-appropriate syllabus focuses on fundamental concepts, critical analysis, problem-solving, and teamwork. Examples of topics include:</p>
                
                <p>We also seek to supplement teachers’ understanding of nutrition, climate change adaptation, and special- or extra-curricular projects.</p>
                
                <p>Whilst school food gardens are an excellent teaching tool, our Curriculum Integration workshops do not require a garden in the facilitation process.</p>

                <h1>Youth Ecopreneur Programme</h1>
                
                <p>The Youth Ecopreneur Programme focuses on youth who want to be included, or grow within, the agriculture sector.</p>
                <p>It is a combination of social cohesion workshops and AgriSeta accredited training with a strong focus on entrepreneurship. It is highly beneficial when part of a programme that includes infrastructure, operations, or leadership.</p>
                <p>These theory and practical sessions are targeted at young adults between the age of 18-35.</p>

                <h1>Adult Basic Education & Training</h1>
               
                <p>This basic education and training for adults focuses on farmer and agro-processing beneficiaries.</p>

                <p>1.Includes formal qualifications, social cohesion workshops, business training, practical sessions, and mentoring and support;</p>
                
                <p>2.Entry to formal NQF (Level 1) qualifications require ABET 3 numeracy, literacy, and communication skills;</p>
                
                <p>3.Exit Level Outcomes include maths literacy, communications, collection, interpretation and reporting of data, and incorporating sustainable farming systems and practices;</p>
               
                <p>4.FTFA’s Business Box includes cash flow management, banking skills, financial administration, records keeping, compliance basics, and business planning;</p>
                
                <p>5.Whilst broadly applicable, materials make use of agriculture and agri-business examples.</p>
            
                <p>Whilst ideally coupled within the FEED Africa programme, this basic education and training is stand alone.</p>

        <h1>Please Support Education, Training & Skills Development</h1>
        <p>Education and training has always been at the core of FTFA. Without it, we feel that social development interventions lack credibility and sustainability. Over the years, FTFA has been at the forefront of this space within the environmental and agricultural sectors. South Africa’s socio-economic and political landscapes are continually changing and we want to ensure that we’re continually innovating with suitable education offerings and appropriate material.</p>
        <p>There has never been a more important time to act within this dynamic space. We implore you to please support our education and training programmes and workshops so that we can continue improving the lives of our beneficiaries and all South Africans.</p>
