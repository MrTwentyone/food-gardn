         <h1> Who Are We?</h1>
        <p>
            We are a team of students from [Your Institution Name], working together on our Joint Group Assignment (JGA) 2025. Our project is dedicated to tackling food insecurity in South Africa by researching and promoting community, school, and household gardening initiatives.

            As a group, we believe that gardens are more than just spaces for plants. They are spaces of hope, learning, and empowerment. Through this project, we aim to bring together research, technology, and community action to support the fight against hunger and poverty, in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 1 – No Poverty and SDG 2 – Zero Hunger).
        </p>
        <h2>👥 Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            To promote sustainable food gardening as a practical and affordable solution to improve nutrition, reduce poverty, and build stronger communities.
        </p>
        <h2>🌍 Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            A South Africa where every household, school, and community has the skills and resources to grow their own fresh food and live healthier, more self-reliant lives.
        </p>
        <h2>💡 Our Values</h2>
        <p>
                Collaboration: Working together as a group and with local communities.

                Innovation: Using creativity, digital tools, and programming to solve real challenges.

                Sustainability: Encouraging eco-friendly and long-lasting gardening practices.

                Empowerment: Sharing knowledge so that people can take control of their food security.
        </p>
        <h2>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Our Team</h2>
        <p>
            We are a diverse group of students with different skills, including:

Research and Data Analysis – investigating case studies and real projects.

Programming (Java) – creating simple tools like garden yield calculators.

Website Design – developing this site to share findings and resources.
