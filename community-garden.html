                <h2>The programme</h2>
                <p>The Community Market Gardens programme is an income-producing vegetable production initiative highly suited to the South African agriculture landscape.</p>

                <p>The programme develops and supports small-holder producers who have passed the threshold of sustainable agriculture but are not yet producing at the scale of a commercial farmer. These community market gardens have the potential to produce a significant amount of food, however.</p>

                <p>Projects involved in the Community Market Gardens programme often underpin the food security of local community (and beyond) while providing the small-holder with a good income and a sustainable livelihood.</p>

                <h1>What is a Market Garden?</h1>
                <p>A market garden — also referred to as a micro-farm — is a small-scale production system of vegetables, herbs, and fruit grown as cash-crops. The intensity and diversity of crops produced, as well as the land size, sets it apart from traditional farming methods. Crops are often sold directly to a community retailer but they can also be aggregated and sold to fresh produce markets.</p>
                <p>In South Africa, community market gardens play important social and business roles. They function as mini-hubs for socialising, agro-processing, and other small (unrelated) business activities. While not a hard-and-fast rule, they are often characterised by groups of women who take responsibility for plots on a larger parcel of land individually, in pairs, or as a small group.</p>

                <p>3.Multiple cash-crops are grow in rotation systems alongside fruit and herbs.</p>
                <p>4.Appropriate<b>infrastructure development.</b></p>
